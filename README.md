# IMAGE-GALLERY
This project showcases a responsive image gallery featuring a sleek design and smooth navigation. Users can explore a collection of 15 images with easy-to-use controls for moving between images or jumping directly to a specific one. The gallery automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices. With a welcoming introduction that fades out after a few seconds, this gallery provides an interactive and visually appealing way to display images using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
